## Optimization Requirements

1. **Route Planning**: Create an optimized route from {depot_location} to deliver fuel to stations
2. **Fuel Type Matching**: Only deliver to stations that match the truck's compartment fuel types
3. **Capacity Planning**: Ensure truck has enough fuel in appropriate compartments for deliveries
4. **Complete Expenditure**: All fuel in truck compartments should be delivered by end of day
5. **Priority**: Stations with lower fuel levels should be prioritized
6. **Request Method**: Consider that IoT stations auto-requested while Manual stations were requested by staff
7. **Route Efficiency**: Minimize total distance while serving maximum stations
8. **Weather Impact**: Account for current weather conditions in timing and safety

## Trip Efficiency Optimization Variables

**CRITICAL: Maximize trip efficiency to minimize overhead costs. Consider these factors:**

1. **Geographic Clustering**: Group nearby stations into single trips to avoid wasted journeys
   - Identify stations within 20-50 km radius that can be serviced in one trip
   - Prioritize multi-stop routes over single-station trips when possible
   - Consider circular routes that return to depot efficiently

2. **Fuel Consumption Efficiency**:
   - Account for truck fuel consumption based on distance, load, and terrain
   - Heavier loads consume more fuel - optimize compartment filling
   - Avoid partially loaded trucks when possible
   - Consider elevation changes and highway vs. city driving

3. **Time-Based Optimization**:
   - Peak traffic hours increase fuel consumption and trip time
   - Early morning departures (6-7 AM) avoid traffic
   - Avoid rush hours (7:30-9:30 AM, 4:30-6:30 PM) in urban areas
   - Plan for driver working hour regulations (max 13 hours driving per day)

4. **Compartment Utilization**:
   - Maximize compartment fill rates to avoid multiple trips
   - Match compartment capacity to station needs
   - Prioritize stations that can utilize full compartment loads
   - Consider mixing stations with complementary fuel needs

5. **Emergency vs. Routine Priority**:
   - Critical stations (< 10% fuel) take absolute priority
   - High-priority stations (10-30% fuel) should be grouped efficiently
   - Medium-priority stations (30-50% fuel) can be scheduled opportunistically
   - Combine emergency and nearby routine deliveries when possible

6. **Historical Performance**:
   - Favor routes with proven efficiency and reliability
   - Consider past delivery times and success rates
   - Learn from previous multi-stop optimizations
   - Avoid routes with known congestion or access issues

7. **Weather and Road Conditions**:
   - Rain, snow, or ice increases fuel consumption by 15-30%
   - Poor visibility may require slower speeds
   - Account for seasonal road conditions
   - Consider alternative routes during adverse weather

8. **Maintenance and Vehicle Status**:
   - Never dispatch trucks due for maintenance
   - Ensure truck fuel level is adequate for round trip
   - Consider vehicle age and fuel efficiency ratings
   - Account for any compartment-specific issues

9. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Calculate cost per kilometer vs. revenue per delivery
   - Prioritize high-value deliveries in efficient clusters
   - Avoid low-volume deliveries to distant stations unless grouped
   - Consider opportunity cost of long-distance single deliveries

10. **Multi-Stop Route Optimization**:
    - **ALWAYS check for nearby stations (within 20-50 km) that also need fuel**
    - Create routes that service 3-5 stations per trip when possible
    - Use traveling salesman problem (TSP) logic for optimal sequencing
    - Minimize backtracking and redundant travel
    - Ensure total route distance is reasonable (< 400 km per trip)
