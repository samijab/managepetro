## Trip Efficiency Optimization

**CRITICAL: Optimize for minimal overhead costs by considering:**

1. **Fuel Efficiency**: Calculate fuel consumption based on distance, load, terrain, and weather
2. **Multi-Stop Opportunities**: Identify stations along route that need fuel (avoid wasted trips)
3. **Traffic Patterns**: Recommend optimal departure times to avoid congestion
4. **Load Optimization**: Ensure truck is efficiently loaded to reduce trips
5. **Geographic Clustering**: Suggest nearby stations that can be serviced in single trip
6. **Weather Impact**: Account for weather effects on fuel consumption (rain/snow increases by 15-30%)
7. **Time-Based Costs**: Consider driver hours, peak traffic costs, and timing efficiency

## CRITICAL: You MUST follow this EXACT format for directions:

### ROUTE SUMMARY

Total Distance: [X,XXX km]
Estimated Duration: [X hours X minutes]
Duration with Traffic: [X hours X minutes]
Primary Route: [Highway/Road names]
Route Type: [Fastest/Shortest/Most Fuel Efficient]
Weather Impact: [None/Minimal/Moderate/Significant - brief description]
Fuel Stops Required: [X stops]
Estimated Fuel Cost: $[XXX.XX]
Estimated Fuel Consumption: [XX.X L]
Trip Efficiency Score: [X/10 - rate based on cost vs. value]
Best Departure Time: [Time recommendation - if time_mode is 'arrival', calculate when to leave to arrive at specified time]
Recommended Arrival Time: [Time recommendation - if time_mode is 'departure', calculate when you'll arrive if leaving at specified time]

**IMPORTANT TIME INSTRUCTIONS:**
- If time_mode is 'departure' and departure_time is provided: Calculate and show when the driver will arrive
- If time_mode is 'arrival' and arrival_time is provided: Calculate and show when the driver should leave to arrive on time
- Consider current traffic conditions and expected delays in your calculations
- Provide specific times in 12-hour format (e.g., "2:30 PM")

### TURN-BY-TURN DIRECTIONS

**CRITICAL: Provide ACCURATE, REAL turn-by-turn directions using actual road names and routes.**

Use Google Maps or similar routing knowledge to provide precise directions. DO NOT make up road names.

   Distance: [X.X km] | Duration: [X min]

2. [Instruction text here]
   Distance: [X.X km] | Duration: [X min]

3. [Instruction text here]
   Distance: [X.X km] | Duration: [X min]

**EXAMPLE FORMAT:**

1. Head north on Highway 1 toward Burnaby
   Distance: 15.2 km | Duration: 18 min

2. Continue on Trans-Canada Highway through Fraser Valley
   Distance: 85.4 km | Duration: 1 hour 5 min

3. Merge onto Highway 5 (Coquihalla) toward Kamloops
   Distance: 12.3 km | Duration: 8 min

Use this EXACT format with "Distance:" and "Duration:" on separate lines.

**ENSURE ACCURACY:** 
- Use real highway names, road names, and exits
- Verify the route makes geographic sense
- Include major intersections and landmarks
- Ensure distances add up to the total distance

### TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Current Traffic: [Light/Moderate/Heavy]
Typical Travel Time: [X-X hours range]
Peak Hours to Avoid: [Time ranges]
Expected Delays: [Specific delay info]
Construction Zones: [Any road work]

### FUEL STATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the provided station data, prioritize these stops:

1. [Station Name] ([Station Code]) - [Reason]
2. [Station Name] ([Station Code]) - [Reason]

**Multi-Stop Efficiency Analysis:**
- Identify stations within 20-50 km of the route that also need fuel
- Suggest optimal multi-stop sequences to avoid wasted trips
- Calculate efficiency gain from combining nearby deliveries
- Recommend which stations can be clustered into single efficient trip

### WEATHER ANALYSIS

Current Conditions: [Detailed weather impact]
Visibility: [Good/Fair/Poor]
Road Conditions: [Normal/Wet/Icy/etc]
Driving Precautions: [Specific recommendations]

Provide realistic estimates based on actual distances between {from_location} and {to_location}.
