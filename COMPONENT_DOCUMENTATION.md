## Updated Core Files

### **routeService.js**
Enhanced `transformApiResponse()` method to extract and structure:
- Route summary details
- Weather impact data
- Traffic conditions
- Fuel stations list
- Recent deliveries
- Available trucks
- Full AI analysis text

### **useRouteData.js**
Expanded state management to include:
- `routeSummary`
- `weatherImpact`
- `trafficConditions`
- `fuelStations`
- `recentDeliveries`
- `availableTrucks`
- `aiAnalysis`

### **RoutePage.jsx**
New responsive layout structure:
1. **Row 1**: ETA Display (1/3) + Turn-by-Turn Directions (2/3)
2. **Row 2**: Weather Impact + Traffic Conditions (2-column)
3. **Row 3**: Fuel Stations + Available Trucks (2-column)
4. **Row 4**: AI Analysis Card (full-width)

## Responsive Design

All components use Tailwind CSS with responsive breakpoints:
- Mobile: Single column, stacked layout
- Tablet (md): Adjusted spacing
- Desktop (lg): Multi-column grid layouts
- All cards have consistent styling:
  - White background
  - Rounded corners (`rounded-xl`)
  - Subtle shadows (`shadow-sm`)
  - Gray borders (`border-gray-200`)

## Testing Notes

To test the components:
1. Start backend with database: `docker compose up -d` (in backend folder)
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev` (in frontend folder)
3. Enter valid locations (e.g., "Toronto" to "Montreal")
4. Click "Optimize Route"
5. All new components should populate with API data

The components gracefully handle missing data by:
- Not rendering if data is null/empty
- Showing "N/A" for missing individual fields
- Maintaining layout consistency
